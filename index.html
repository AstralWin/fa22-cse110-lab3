        <hr>

        <p>Finalized the organization of the social party. Started ironing out details
            such as the budget and timeslot. Nelson Sim was chosen to lead the project

        <mark>Time Allocated: 20 minutes</mark>
        <mark>Presenter: Thomay Kay</mark>
        <div><strong>Creation of Flyers</strong></div>
        <p>Flyers would serve as a good way to introduce the club to old and new students
            alike. Physical flyers could be taped on seats in classrooms and on bulletin boards
            to raise awareness about the club. <span><em>Person in Charge: </em></span><span><em>Thomas Kay</em></span>
        </p>

        <mark>Presenter: Nelson Sim</mark>
        <div><strong>Reserving the University Banquet Hall</strong></div>
        <p>After personally inspecting the venue, the University Banquet Hall seems like
            the perfect place to hold the social party as it can accomodate a large number
            of people as well as being under budget. <span><em>Person in Charge: </em></span><span><em>Nelson Sim & Chris Lai</em></span>

    <h2>Miscellaneous Comments</h2>
    <p>Jason Rodriguez said that we should organized a farewell party for previous
        board of directors. This could also act as an introduction to the new board of directors.
        Everyone agreed with this proposal and the details will be dealt with in the next meeting. <br><br>
        Tyler Lee said that he was going to be away for a week so he would not be able to
        attend the next meeting. He offered his apologies for the late notice.
